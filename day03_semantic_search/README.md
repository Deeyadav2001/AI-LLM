## Day 03 – Semantic Search Using Embeddings

### Objective
To build a simple semantic search system that retrieves and ranks documents based on meaning.

---

### What I Implemented
- Created a small document dataset
- Converted documents and queries into embeddings
- Ranked documents using cosine similarity
- Displayed results in descending order of relevance

---

### Key Concepts Learned
- Semantic search retrieves information by meaning, not exact words
- Vector similarity enables modern AI search systems
- Ranking by relevance is a core component of RAG pipelines
- Embeddings + similarity form the foundation of intelligent search

---

### Technologies Used
- Python
- sentence-transformers
- scikit-learn
- Vector similarity (cosine similarity)

---

### Outcome
Built a working semantic search system that correctly prioritizes relevant documents and filters out irrelevant ones.
