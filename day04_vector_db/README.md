## Day 04 – Vector Database Using FAISS

### Objective
To implement an efficient vector-based retrieval system using FAISS and understand how large-scale semantic search is performed in real AI systems.

---

### What I Implemented
- Generated embeddings for a set of text documents
- Created a FAISS vector index to store embeddings
- Added document embeddings to the FAISS index
- Converted user queries into embeddings
- Retrieved the nearest vectors using FAISS search
- Mapped retrieved vectors back to original documents

---

### Key Concepts Learned
- Vector databases store embeddings, not raw text
- FAISS enables fast and scalable similarity search
- Indexed retrieval is essential for large datasets
- FAISS replaces manual similarity comparison at scale
- Vector retrieval is a core building block of RAG systems

---

### Technologies Used
- Python
- sentence-transformers
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Vector embeddings
- Nearest-neighbor search

---

### Outcome
Built a scalable vector search system using FAISS that efficiently retrieves the most relevant documents based on semantic similarity.
